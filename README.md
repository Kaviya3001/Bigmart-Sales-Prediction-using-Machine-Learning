# Project Description
   The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the sales of products at BigMart stores. By leveraging historical sales data along with various product and store attributes, the model will be able to make predictions for future sales. This information can be valuable for BigMart to optimize inventory management and plan promotions effectively.
   
# Dataset
   Dataset is taken from kaggle dataset_link
   
# Data description
